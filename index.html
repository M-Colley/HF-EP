    <h2>2. Project</h2>

    <h3>Short description</h3>
    <p>The Human Factors Extension Pack (HF‑EP) for the open source traffic simulation software SUMO, Simulation of Urban Mobility, enhances traffic simulation by consolidating five proven SUMO prototypes into a single, maintained add on. It delivers standardized Python APIs for traffic related agents, sensors, user interfaces, and data logging, versioned schemas, packaging on PyPI and Conda Forge, containers, and accessible documentation with tutorials and German scenarios. The focus is on software infrastructure, not a new end user app. Labs and developers gain a dependable foundation to model human factors in mobility systems.</p>
    <p class="wc">Words, 92/100</p>

    <h3>Societal challenge</h3>
    <p>Mobility research often fails to account for human behavior at scale, which leads to unsafe or inequitable deployments and wasted public funds. Fragmented tooling means each lab reinvents ad hoc scripts, brittle integrations, and undocumented data formats, which block reproducibility and slow evidence based traffic policy. HF‑EP targets this gap as a software infrastructure that many others can build on. It lowers the entry cost for universities, civic technology groups, and small consultancies to test, for example, pedestrian safety measures, automated vehicle interfaces, scooter policies, and vertiport plans before they reach streets or airspace. By standardizing APIs, schemas, and packaging, and by shipping clear documentation and teaching assets, the project converts scattered prototypes into technically reliable building blocks. The indirect audience is large because developers integrate libraries into widely used applications, while educators and public bodies benefit from repeatable studies and transparent methods.</p>
    <p class="wc">Words, 142/175</p>

    <h3>Technical approach</h3>
    <p>HF‑EP will be a typed Python package with a modular core and plugins. Core abstractions cover Environment, Agent, Sensor, Interface, Scenario, and Collector. A compatibility layer preserves legacy scripts. Configuration utilizes TOML and JSON Schema, incorporating semantic version stamps. CI on GitHub Actions builds and tests across Linux, Windows, and macOS, publishes signed wheels to PyPI and conda forge packages, and ships container images on the GitHub Container Registry, GHCR. Testing combines unit, property based, and integration tests with headless SUMO runs. Docs use MkDocs Material with API references from type hints and runnable tutorials. Releases follow semantic versioning with LTS branch and a deprecation policy. The design follows Prototype Fund principles, Data minimization, all data stays local, no cloud dependency. User friendliness, clear tutorials and examples enable participation without programming skills, German tutorials lower language barriers. Adaptability, modular architecture with plugins, TOML configs instead of code changes, scenario DSL for domain specific adaptations. Open Source, MIT license, open governance, public roadmap.</p>
    <p class="wc">Words, 163/175</p>

    <h3>Current status and planned additions</h3>
    <p>Status, five released prototypes exist, PedSUMO, HUD‑SUMO, UAM‑SUMO, MM‑SUMO, plus Generative Traffic Agents. They answer narrow research questions but suffer from version drift, duplicated utilities, sparse tests, and uneven documentation. Planned, merge into one namespace with a stable API, freeze a versioned data schema with validators, raise automated test coverage, ship cross platform packages and containers, add a headless mode, publish accessible docs with tutorials and scenarios for German traffic environments, adopt semantic releases with LTS, and install open governance and contribution pathways.</p>
    <p class="wc">Words, 86/100</p>

    <h3>Similar approaches and differentiation</h3>
    <p>SUMO with TraCI offers base simulation, CARLA and CityFlow focus on vehicle autonomy or mesoscopic flows, MATSim targets activity based modelling. None provides a maintained human factors layer with stable APIs for user interface interventions, pedestrian intent exchange, micro mobility on sidewalks, and urban air mobility inside SUMO, together with university ready packs. HF‑EP is infrastructure first beyond academic use. It standardizes schemas, packaging, testing, and governance so developers and educators can extend and trust one stack. It enhances reuse within the existing SUMO ecosystem rather than creating a parallel platform.</p>
    <p class="wc">Words, 92/100</p>

    <h3>Target groups and outreach</h3>
    <p>Primary, Civic tech initiatives, for example Code for Germany labs, municipal transport planners, university teaching, MSc Transport Planning, HCI. Secondary, Research Software Engineers in HCI and Transport. Tertiary, Policy labs and NGOs. Distribution, PyPI and conda forge packages, containers on GHCR, and a versioned docs site with runnable tutorials. Engagement, a public Slack, monthly clinics, mentored pull requests, workshops at CHI, AutoUI, and the SUMO User Conference, and educator kits integrated into MSc modules. Adoption is tracked with transparent metrics and migration guides.</p>
    <p class="wc">Words, 83/100</p>

    <h3>Milestones for six months</h3>
    <p>Month 1, governance and roadmap published, API blueprint and repo unification, CI scaffold. Month 2, core package skeleton and config schema, first unit and integration tests, docs site scaffold with quick start example. Month 3, SUMO plugin alpha, compatibility shims, nightly containers, first tutorial, and German scenario seed. Month 4, scenario DSL beta, collectors writing Parquet, clinic number one. Month 5, benchmarks and caching, headless visualizer, educator kit v1, release candidate. Month 6, v1 release with signed packages, LTS branch, and deprecation policy, two case studies, and an adoption report.</p>

    <h3>Experience and motivation</h3>
    <p>The team blends research, software engineering, HCI and human factors, traffic simulation. We maintain the existing prototypes, publish open source code and datasets, and teach reproducible methods, for example see <a href=\"https://autoui-open-data-initiative.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://autoui-open-data-initiative.github.io/</a>. Our goal is to replace brittle scripts with a maintained infrastructure that others can extend. Motivation is raising the baseline for safe and inclusive mobility research, reducing duplicated effort across labs, and creating a durable teaching stack that seeds future contributors.</p>

    <h2>4. Second Stage</h2>

    <h3>Apply for four month extension</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>

    <h3>Plan for sustainable growth</h3>
    <p>The second stage ensures long term usability through community ownership. We establish open governance, maintainers council with decision log, triage rights for two external contributors so the project lives beyond its founders. We complete teaching infrastructure, video workshops with subtitles, migration guides for legacy setups, assessment materials for universities. We professionalize packaging, conda forge automation, release playbooks, support matrix and document service standards, issue response time, deprecation policy. Two partner case studies, City to be decided, e scooter zones, Ulm University and University College London, HCI teaching, demonstrate practical viability. An impact brief for administrations lowers adoption barriers. Outreach to German HCI and transport communities and adoption metrics identify blockers. Preparation of follow on funding, RSE time, institutional teaching support, secures maintenance after Prototype Fund.</p>

    <h3>Second Stage milestones</h3>
    <p>Month 1, Maintainers Council ratified, release and deprecation playbooks, clinic schedule agreed upon, educator pack v2. Month 2, two mentored contributor sprints, migration guides, conda forge automation complete. Month 3, partner case study one and two published, impact brief released, adoption metrics review and adjustments. Month 4, governance refresh and rota, external maintainers active in triage, funding proposals submitted for maintenance, community report with lessons for long term stewardship.</p>
